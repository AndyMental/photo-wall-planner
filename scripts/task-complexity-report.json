      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the setup process into subtasks such as: initializing Next.js 15 with TypeScript, installing Tailwind CSS, integrating Framer Motion, configuring Vercel deployment, setting up Supabase with PostgreSQL, establishing the folder structure, and configuring CI/CD.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple frameworks and services (Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Vercel, Supabase), each with its own configuration steps. Ensuring smooth integration and deployment adds to the complexity, requiring careful sequencing and verification steps.[1][2][3][4]"
